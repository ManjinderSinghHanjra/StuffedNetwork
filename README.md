# StuffedNetwork
This project is aimed to contain an IRC Server. But I'm designing it in a modular way so that with minimum possible alterations it can become useful in other projects. 
Planned features:
* Simple TCP IRC Server
* Simple TCP IRC Client
* Encryption Algorithms
* Multithreading to handle mutliple clients efficiently
-------------------------------------------------------
* Modular TCP/UDP Connection Library
* Various TCP/UPD Utilities
