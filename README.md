# StuffedNetwork
This project is aimed to contain a IRC Server. But I'm designing it in a modular way so that with minimum possible alterations it can become useful in other projects. Alongwith, I'm also developing client-side program. Gradually, I'll add various other features to it like security encryptions, multithreading to handle multiple clients efficiently.
